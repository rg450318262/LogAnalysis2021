"How good are you at assessing and mitigating avalanche danger?

Assessment of and mitigating avalanche danger involve evaluation and interpretation of snow, weather, and terrain. The six categories below describe different levels of avalanche assessment and mitigation skills. Please choose the category that best matches your skill level. If you do not have all the skills listed in a category, please choose a category with lower skill requirements.



1. Beginner

I don't have any experience of, or knowledge in, assessment of avalanche danger.  



2. Limited skills

I am AWARE that avalanche danger is assessed on a scale from 1 = low to 5 = extreme, and that most avalanches occur in terrain >30°. I know that fresh avalanches are signs of avalanche danger.



3. Basic skills

In addition to level 2: I am AWARE that different kinds of avalanche problems exist. I can identify key avalanche terrain (start zones, run-out zones, and terrain traps). I know how to INTERPRET obvious warning signs (e.g., fresh avalan",1. Beginner<>2. Limited skills<>3. Basic skills<>4. Moderate to advanced skills<>5. Advanced skills<>6. Expert skills
"How good are you at (non-motorized) backcountry riding?

Please choose the category where you fulfil all the described skills (going up and down the mountain). If you do not fulfil all criterias please choose a catergory with lower requirements. The focus in this question is your technical riding skills, not navigation or orientation. 



1. Beginner

I am working on developing balance, position and speed control with backcountry equipment on GENTLE terrain (open fields and sparse trees with slope up to 25°)



2. Limited skills

I can negotiate GENTLE terrain without problems both uphill and downhill in almost ALL snow conditions. I can handle STEEP terrain (slope up to 35°) if the terrain is OPEN and snow conditions are GOOD.



3. Basic skills

In addition to level 2: I can negotiate STEEP terrain both uphill and downhill without problems in almost ALL snow conditions, if the terrain is OPEN. I can handle chutes and and trees in STEEP terrain if snow conditions are GOOD.
